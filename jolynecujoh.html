                        In 2011, Jolyne Cujoh is wrongfully sentenced to 15 years in prison after<br>
                        being framed for vehicular manslaughter following a car accident.<br>
                        She is incarcerated at Green Dolphin Street Prison, also known as the<br>
                        "Aquarium," near Port St. Lucie, Florida. Her father, Jotaro Kujo, gives <br>
                        her a pendant that triggers the awakening of her Stand powers. As strange <br>
                        events unfold,Jotaro reveals that a disciple of Dio framed Jolyne in <br>
                        order to kill her in prison. Jotaro tries to rescue her, but it turns <br>
                        out to be a trap. After a battle with a Stand named Whitesnake, Jotaroâ€™s<br>
                        memories and Stand abilities are stolen, leaving him in a comatose state.
