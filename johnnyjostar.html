                        In September 1890, jockeys from around the world compete in the Steel Ball Run,<br>
                        a cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York City, offering a grand<br>
                        prize of fifty million dollars. Johnny Joestar, a paraplegic, enters the race to<br>
                        learn about the mysterious Spin ability from Gyro Zeppeli, a former Neapolitan<br>
                        executioner who temporarily restored his mobility. Although initially rivals, <br>
                        Johnny and Gyro form a bond as they face numerous dangers from assassins,<br>
                        outlaws, and violent competitors. The race, organized by oil tycoon Steven Steel,<br>
                        is secretly manipulated by U.S. President Funny Valentine to collect pieces of <br>
                        the Holy Corpse, believed to be the body of Jesus Christ.
