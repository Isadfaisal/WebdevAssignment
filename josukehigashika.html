                    He is a man with retrograde Amnesia, and might be<br>
                    made from 2 people, as he demonstrates being<br>
                    strategic and also being very passive aggreasiveness.<br>
                    rarely at times he resorts to killing his targets.

                        After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, strange structures known as <br>
                        Wall Eyes appear near the coast of Morioh, causing the ground beneath <br>
                        them to gain the ability to swap traits of buried objects. A local <br>
                        student, Yasuho Hirose, discovers an amnesiac youth buried under one of <br>
                        the Wall Eyes, whom she temporarily names "Josuke." The two work <br>
                        together to uncover his memories and identity, with Yasuho suspecting <br>
                        Josuke is linked to a missing doctor, Yoshikage Kira. During her <br>
                        investigation, Josuke learns that he is a fusion of Kira and another <br>
                        individual, leading to further mysteries.
